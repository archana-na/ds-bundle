# dsbundle

The main aim of this project is to bundle the implementations of multiple data structures into a jar packaging that can be imported directly into the gradle projects from the Maven Repository.

This helps the developers to avoid manual implementation of the data structures whenever necessary.

Contributors are always welcome.

If you want to contribute to this project, do issue a pull request to the repository with the implementation of necessary data structures. Make sure the code follows the coding standards, implements Generics whereever necessary and has test cases implemented. Thanks in advance.

Cheers!
